# Explanation of variable codes in dataset
#
# Time: time gap between trials measured in days
# Novelty: whether the same or different objects were used in consecutive trials
# DomLabYN: domestic animal (yes or no)
# LabLabYN: lab-reared animal (yes or no)
# WildLabYN: wild-caught animal (yes or no)
# Max_lifespan: maximum lifespan extracted from AnAge database
# Time_scaled: time gap as a proportion of lifespan
# Measured_attributes: behavioural variable quantified
# Terminology: term used to describe the behavioural phenotype
# Terminology2: term used to describe the behavioural phenotype ()
# Species_maxlifespan_days: maximum lifespan extracted from AnAge database measured in days
# Context: whether object was placed in a neutral place, close to food or close to nest (categorical variable)
# FoodYN: whether object was placed next to food (yes or no)
# NestYN: whether object was placed next to nest(yes or no)	
# R_type: whether repeatability or correlation was used 
# LongTermYN: long or short term between trials
# NoGaussianYN: whether gaussian or non-gaussian models were used
# PCAYN: whether consistency was calculated as a composite measure
# AverageYN: whether consistency was calculated as an average measure
# SingBehCorYN: whether consistency was calculated for one variable
# MultipleAssaysYN: whether novel object was the only test in the paper
# MultiTraitsYN: whether multiple variables were measured during novel object trials
